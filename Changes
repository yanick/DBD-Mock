Revision history for Perl extension DBD::Mock.

0.13 
    - added prepare_cached as suggested by Rob Kinyon 
      in RT bug #7331. Also added his test script in
      15_prepare_cached.t

0.12 Thurs Sept 2 2004
** First version maintained by Stevan Little <stevan@iinteractive.com> **
    - built up the test suite to 89.7% coverage
    - removed the undocumented 'mock_auto_commit' since it really
      was not very useful at this point.
    - added the DBD::Mock::Pool functionality
        - added tests for this
        - added documentation for this
    - added pod.t to test suite
    - removed AUTOLOAD in DBD::Mock::StatementTrack and replaced it with
      hand coded methods (sorry I really dislike AUTOLOAD)
    - centralized error handling in DBD::Mock::_error_handler

0.11  Fri Jul 23 10:35:13 EDT 2004

      - Fix CPAN Bug #7057: add a no-op 'disconnect_all()' to
      DBD::Mock::dr to support DBI versions earlier than 1.34.

      - Add the ability to create SQL parsers that get fired on a
      prepare(). This way you can ensure your application generates
      correct SQL and have the system fail at the right time. Thanks
      to Rob Kinyon <Rob.Kinyon@progressive-medical.com> for the idea.

0.10  Sat May  8 14:12:39 EDT 2004

      - Incorporate number of patches from Stevan Little to implement
      'mock_can_connect', which allows you to simulate a downed
      database. Add supporting tests for database and statement usage.

      - Add the ability for 'mock_add_resultset' to associate a
      resultset with a particular SQL statement. Thanks to Stevan for
      the idea.

      - Add documentation for database handle property
      'mock_add_resultset'
