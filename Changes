Revision history for Perl extension DBD::Mock.

0.17 Thurs Nov 4 2004
    - added the following items:
        - a 'mock_num_rows' attribute which will give you 
          the number of records affected/returned by the
          last statement
        - a num_rows method in the DBD::Mock::StatementTrack 
          object, which is where the above attribute gets it's
          value
    - added the 'rows' method for statement handles (which didnt
      work before)

0.16 Sat Oct 30 2004
    - minor change to the DBD::Mock::StatementTrack::Iterator
      behavior. It no longer derefs the history array, so it
      maintains a reference to it and therefore can be used like
      this:
          get-statement-iterator
          run-query
          check-next-statement-in-iterator
          run-query          
          check-next-statement-in-iterator
          ...
      This prevents the need to re-fetch the iterator after 
      each query. 

0.15 Fri Oct 29 2004
    - added the DBD::Mock::StatementTrack::Iterator
      object which can be accessed from the 
      'mock_all_history_iterator' attribute. 
        - write the docs and test for it

0.14 Fri Oct 29 2004
    - added the mock_last_insert_id attribute
      which will get incremented upon each INSERT
      query run. 
        - added tests and docs for this
    - added the mock_start_insert_id attirbute
      so that you can both reset and set the start
      number for mock_last_insert_id
        - added tests and docs for this
        
    ** EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE (use caution) **
    - added a feature to alias attributes. Basically it
      allows you to alias an expected attribute like 
      'mysql_insertid' to something DBD::Mock already has
      like 'mock_last_insert_id'. 
      Right now this feature is highly experimental, and 
      has been added as a first attempt automatically handle
      some of the DBD specific attributes which are commonly
      used/accessed in DBI programming. 

0.13 Thurs Oct 28 2004
    - added prepare_cached as suggested by Rob Kinyon 
      in RT bug #7331. Also added his test script in
      15_prepare_cached.t

0.12 Thurs Sept 2 2004
** First version maintained by Stevan Little <stevan@iinteractive.com> **
    - built up the test suite to 89.7% coverage
    - removed the undocumented 'mock_auto_commit' since it really
      was not very useful at this point.
    - added the DBD::Mock::Pool functionality
        - added tests for this
        - added documentation for this
    - added pod.t to test suite
    - removed AUTOLOAD in DBD::Mock::StatementTrack and replaced it with
      hand coded methods (sorry I really dislike AUTOLOAD)
    - centralized error handling in DBD::Mock::_error_handler

0.11  Fri Jul 23 10:35:13 EDT 2004

      - Fix CPAN Bug #7057: add a no-op 'disconnect_all()' to
      DBD::Mock::dr to support DBI versions earlier than 1.34.

      - Add the ability to create SQL parsers that get fired on a
      prepare(). This way you can ensure your application generates
      correct SQL and have the system fail at the right time. Thanks
      to Rob Kinyon <Rob.Kinyon@progressive-medical.com> for the idea.

0.10  Sat May  8 14:12:39 EDT 2004

      - Incorporate number of patches from Stevan Little to implement
      'mock_can_connect', which allows you to simulate a downed
      database. Add supporting tests for database and statement usage.

      - Add the ability for 'mock_add_resultset' to associate a
      resultset with a particular SQL statement. Thanks to Stevan for
      the idea.

      - Add documentation for database handle property
      'mock_add_resultset'

0.01  Sun Mar  7 23:24:24 EST 2004

      Initial version spawned from DBD::NullP shipped with the

      original code.
