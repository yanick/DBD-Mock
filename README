DBD::Mock
=====================

This is a simple mock DBD implementation used for testing. It's
entirely self-contained so that you can extract the single library
file (DBD/Mock.pm), put it in your own distribution and be able to run
DBI-based tests even though you don't have information about a
database. (If you're doing so you should probably get rid of the docs
to save space...)
